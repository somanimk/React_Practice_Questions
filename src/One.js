// JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, which makes it easier to build user interfaces.

// Key Points:
// Looks like HTML: JSX lets you write code that looks like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript under the hood.
// Used in React: JSX is used to define what the UI should look like by combining HTML-like syntax with JavaScript logic.
// Example:
// jsx
// Copy code
// const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
// This code is JSX, and itâ€™s converted into JavaScript by React to render the <h1> element on the web page.
// In short:
// JSX allows you to write HTML inside JavaScript easily, making UI development in React simpler and more readable.
